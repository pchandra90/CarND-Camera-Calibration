## Camera Calibration and Undistort Transform with OpenCV

- The camera_calibration.ipynb notebook in this repository contains code to calculate the camera matrix and distortion coefficients using the images in the "calibration_wide" folder.

- The undistort_transform.ipynb notebook in this repository contains code to transform distorted to undistorted image. This camera calibration parameters and prospective transformation.
